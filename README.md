# E09a-Scripting

Continuing on the last exercise, we added a value for score, lives, and an end-game screen that is displayed if the lives counter hits zero. Updating the scripts for the ball and paddle allow for the score and lives counter to keep track of location and conditon. Same with the scripts for those very counters.
